## Development

### Reading Materials

### Code Style

- Project layout [grouped by domain](https://marmelab.com/blog/2015/12/17/react-directory-structure.html)
- Components should always export their Container component as default
- Test files should have filenames that mirror the files they are testing, but end with `.spec.ts`
